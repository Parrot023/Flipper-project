This project is about turning an old classic pinball machince, into an automatic flipper beast. It's done by ball detecting sensors
above the flippers, and an Arduino (Nano) activating the flippers via relays.


3D print info:

Body depth: 10 mm.
Body height: 7 mm.
Body lenght: is defined by number number of repeats.

divider (the wall between each sensor): 3 mm.

screw hole size: 3 mm.

cut out length (for sensor): 11 mm.
cut out height (for sensor): 5 mm.
